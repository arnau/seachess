## [Trade-offs under pressure](https://blog.acolyer.org/2020/01/22/trade-offs-under-pressure-part-1/)

This is the first part of a digested walkthrough of the paper [Trade-offs
under pressure: heuristics and observations of teams resolving internet
service
outages](https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/8084520),
Allspaw, Masters thesis, Lund University, 2015.

If the topic doesn't catch your attention, have a tour around their archives;
[The morning paper](https://blog.acolyer.org/) is a remarkable place to find
interesting papers on a wide range of topics.

## [When Elixir's performance becomes Rust-y](https://www.theguild.nl/when-elixirs-performance-becomes-rust-y/)

An article about how to use Rust with Elixir using
[rustler](https://github.com/rusterlium/rustler), a library to create Erlang
NIF functions in Rust.

Worth remembering that
[Discord also does this mix](https://blog.discordapp.com/using-rust-to-scale-elixir-for-11-million-concurrent-users-c6f19fc029d3).

## [Rust at speed: building a fast, concurrent database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s19G6n0UjsM) (video)

In this talk from early 2019, Jon Gjengset explains in a very succinctly
manner the idea behind Rust ownership and what is this `unsafe` thing in Rust
all about. And of course, the database he is working on,
[Noria](https://github.com/mit-pdos/noria) is the jewel of the talk.
