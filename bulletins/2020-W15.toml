comment = """
An article on working with Git without branches. An interesting contrast to
last week's [How the Creators of Git Do
Branching](https://hackernoon.com/how-the-creators-of-git-do-branches-e6fcc57270fb).

title = "Why you should stop using Google Analytics on your website"
url = "https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics"
comment = """
An article to help you consider alternatives to Google Analytics.

Although the article has good content, keep in mind Plausible is a competitor
of Google Analytics. That said, [Plausible have their code
open](https://github.com/plausible-insights/plausible) so it's a plus in
transparency.

title = "Black illustrations"

comment = """
A set of illustrations for free (or anything you think is the right price). In
their words:

> There just isn't a lot of diversity in design.  People of color are often
underrepresented in illustrations, lacking in the design process and often go
unseen in visuals across the internet.

title = "Why I'm leaving Elm"
url = "https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/why-im-leaving-elm/"
comment = """
An article with lots of reasons why you might not want to invest in Elm. This
in particular is what made me stop considering Elm as a worthwhile option
around the time 0.19 was released:

> They do not say “Why don’t you just”, they say “You must just” — despite not
knowing anything about the rest of the project-specific constraints that you
are taking into account and couldn’t explain — and then they build that
opinion into the compiler itself.

Even if you don't care about Elm, it's a good article to reflect on open
source and governance.

title = "From failure to Fehler"
url = "https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/failure-to-fehler/"
comment = """
An article on error handling in Rust by the author of
[failure](https://crates.io/crates/failure) and
[fehler](https://crates.io/crates/fehler).

From the same author, worth a read [A brief apology of Ok-Wrapping](https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/why-ok-wrapping/).

An article with a handful of ways you can avoid using PostGIS by taking
advantage of Postgres features and lightweight extensions.

It links to [SpatiaLite](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index),
a spatial extension for SQLite.
