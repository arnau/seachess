title = "Writing WebAssembly in Rust and runing it in Deno!"
url = "https://dev.to/lampewebdev/writing-webassembly-in-rust-and-runing-it-in-deno-144j"
comment = """
A tutorial to begin with Deno and Webassembly.

[Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) is starting to get some traction in
the Javascript space and With Webassembly it's an attractive combination.

If you haven't read about Deno before, try this [Deno overview](https://blog.bitsrc.io/what-is-deno-and-will-it-replace-nodejs-a13aa1734a74).

If you have, and you are into Typescript, check the rationale behind Deno's
[TypeScript compiler in Rust](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/5432).

title = "Structuring and handling errors in 2020"
url = "https://nick.groenen.me/posts/rust-error-handling/"
comment = """
An article that explains the rationale of approaching error handling
differently for libraries than for applications in Rust. It showcases both
approaches using [anyhow](https://crates.io/crates/anyhow) and
[thiserror](https://crates.io/crates/thiserror).

Beware of the performance hit of using anyhow though. The comment at the end
explains the trade-off well.
