comment = """
A format to structure geospatial information in SQLite.

A couple of weeks back I played with the UK geospatial information which
crystallised in [Addresspack](https://github.com/arnau/addresspack) which is a
tool to transform the odd format Ordnance Survey provides to a ready to use
SQLite database.

The good news is that now they are improving and starting to offer data in
GeoPackage which, besides using SQLite, defines a particular way to lay the
geospatial data.
