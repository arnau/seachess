summary = "A graph database focused on knowledge graph representation. The new\nversion, 1.1, introduces a new storage system with revision control à la git.\nIn their words:\n\n> We adopt a delta encoding approach to updates (‘like git, but for data’)\nwhich provides the whole suite of revision control features: branch, merge,\nsquash, rollback, blame, and time-travel facilitating CI/CD approaches on\ndata.\n\nIn almost fifteen years with an on-and-off relationship with RDF, TerminusDB\nis the first database that I try that doesn't force you to manage all the\ncomplexity typically associated with RDF. I believe they have found a\nplausible abstraction for people that want to work with graphs without\ninvesting in the guts and bowels of RDF."
