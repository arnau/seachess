title = "Delivering on an architecture strategy"
summary = "An article highlighting fundamental practices in a multi-discipline _product_\nteam and where a technical and an architectural strategy play their part.\n\nThere is a bit I dislike though, the categorisation of people as either\n\"doers\" or \"dreamers\". It is oversimplistic and gives a blank check to certain\ntype of people that _think_ they are doing their part by just dreaming\nunrealistic half-baked ideas."
