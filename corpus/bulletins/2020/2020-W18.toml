A tutorial of how to setup an AWS Lambda function with Rust, consuming

The [Rusoto](https://github.com/rusoto/rusoto) project, although not yet 1.0,
is already covering quite a few [AWS services](https://www.rusoto.org/supported-aws-services.html).

The [Amadeus](https://github.com/constellation-rs/amadeus) project is worth a

An article exploring the parallelisms of _degeneracy_, from
biology, applied to other situations like technical solutions, professional
career, etc.

If you are like me, you'll have to ignore the bits that seem to imply that
Nature has some sort of intention or grand plan. Even with that, there are
some good seeds for thought in there.
