summary = "An article describing a lifecycle to frame how to iterate on a product\nreliably.\n\n> Building great software is not about being perfect. It’s about reliably\n> making progress.\n\nIt's a better framed version of [“perfect is the enemy of\ngood”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good)\nhighlighting that although good enough is enough, the story doesn't end there.\n\nAfter all, “quality is relative” without a framework to assess what you have\ndone is just accepting you don't care about the result, you only care about\ngetting away with it."
