title = "Structuring and handling errors in 2020"
summary = "An article that explains the rationale of approaching error handling\ndifferently for libraries than for applications in Rust. It showcases both\napproaches using [anyhow](https://crates.io/crates/anyhow) and\n[thiserror](https://crates.io/crates/thiserror).\n\nBeware of the performance hit of using anyhow though. The comment at the end\nexplains the trade-off well."
