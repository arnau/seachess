An article exploring a version-controlled workflow to reduce the friction of the single-task mindset that tooling like Git encourage.

A GPU-accelerated terminal emulator written in Rust with multiplex terminal panes, tabs and windows a-la tmux.

Wezterm is comparable to [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) in terms of features. A compelling difference is the choice of using Lua for the configuration instead of a custom language.
