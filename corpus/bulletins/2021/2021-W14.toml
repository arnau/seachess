summary = "An offline-first knowledge base tool on top of a folder of Markdown files.\n\nI've been using this tool for the last few months and although it's still not a mature tool it has become my main tool to manage my knowledge base both at home and at work.\n\nThat said, I couldn't use it without a few plugins to enhance it:\n\n- [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), to query the knowledge base and display results as tables or lists.\n- [Mind Map](https://github.com/lynchjames/obsidian-mind-map), to display a mind map out of a Markdown structure.\n- [Sliding Panes](https://github.com/deathau/sliding-panes-obsidian), to stack open panes on the side.\n- [Minimal Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings), to tweak the interface to be less noisy.\n- [Metatable](https://github.com/arnau/obsidian-metatable), to display the full frontmatter."
