An offline-first knowledge base tool on top of a folder of Markdown files.

I've been using this tool for the last few months and although it's still not a mature tool it has become my main tool to manage my knowledge base both at home and at work.

That said, I couldn't use it without a few plugins to enhance it:

- [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview), to query the knowledge base and display results as tables or lists.
- [Mind Map](https://github.com/lynchjames/obsidian-mind-map), to display a mind map out of a Markdown structure.
- [Sliding Panes](https://github.com/deathau/sliding-panes-obsidian), to stack open panes on the side.
- [Minimal Settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings), to tweak the interface to be less noisy.
- [Metatable](https://github.com/arnau/obsidian-metatable), to display the full frontmatter."""
