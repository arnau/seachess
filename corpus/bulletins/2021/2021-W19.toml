A chat service with threads, topics, custom emojis with the possibility to run your own server.

Chat applications are popular and surprisingly difficult to get right. I currently use [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Keybase](https://keybase.io/), [Discord](https://discord.com/), [Telegram](https://telegram.org/), [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) and have been testing [Rocket](https://rocket.chat/), [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) and what not.

And not a single one of them ticks all the boxes."""
