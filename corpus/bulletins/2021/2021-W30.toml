title = "What's bad about Julia"
summary = "An article going into the bad parts of [Julia](https://julialang.org/) according to the author. The first one, compile time latency is quite something:\n\n> What's happening is that Julia is compiling the code needed for its REPL and its integration with your editor.\n> This \"runtime\" compilation causes the lag we call compile time latency. [...] A small script [...] may have a 2 second latency, even if the computation itself takes microseconds.\n> [...] When using Python or Rust, you may be used to running some tests from command line, modifying a source file in the editor [...]. This workflow is not feasible in Julia - instead, you are essentially forced to into _REPL driven development_ [...]"
