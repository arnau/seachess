title = "It's Time to Retire the CSV"
summary = "An article ranting about the shortcomings of CSV. Although I don't believe the proposed way forward is remotely feasible, I share the frustration.\n\nAnd I deeply disagree with the “CSV is simple and readable by humans”. Some CSV can be simple, some can be readable but editing a wide CSV with lots of variations in their values (e.g. empty fields, double quotes, empty double quotes) makes it a nightmare to scan without the aid of a tool.\nFail to add the right amount of commas and the CSV will be broken."
