An article on the potential consequences of the Let's Encrypt root certificate expiring given the amount of places that rely on it.

For reference, last September 9 Let's Encrypt said: “We have reached 2 billion certificates issued!”. My website is one among them.

As the article highlights, the problem is not on the websites that use Let's Encrypt necessarily, it has more to do with the fact that root certificates are trusted by devices (e.g. web browsers) and when they are not timely updated things break."""
