summary = "A small, self-contained cross-platform CLI tool written in Rust to serve files via HTTP. For a long time I've been using [devd](https://github.com/cortesi/devd/) but now I'm switching to miniserve just because it's easier to install and keep up to date."

title = "webassembly: the new kubernetes?"
summary = "An article comparing WebAssembly and Kubernetes. I would say a better comparison would be with OCI containers which seems to be the conclusion as well:\n\n> I compare WebAssembly to K8s, but really it's more like processes and private\n> namespaces. So one answer to the question as initially posed is that no,\n> WebAssembly is not the next Kubernetes; that next thing is waiting to be built,\n> though I know of a few organizations that have started already.\n\nAs noted in the comments, [Krustlet](https://github.com/krustlet/krustlet) is a project to keep an eye on."
