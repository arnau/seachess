An article comparing WebAssembly and Kubernetes. I would say a better comparison would be with OCI containers which seems to be the conclusion as well:

> WebAssembly is not the next Kubernetes; that next thing is waiting to be built,

As noted in the comments, [Krustlet](https://github.com/krustlet/krustlet) is a project to keep an eye on."""
