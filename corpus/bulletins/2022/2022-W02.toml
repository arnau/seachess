title = "My first impressions of web3"
summary = "An article assessing what web3 means and how its so claimed distributed principle might not be so distributed after all.\n\n> Given the history of why web1 became web2, what seems strange to me about\n> web3 is that technologies like ethereum have been built with many of the same\n> implicit trappings as web1. To make these technologies usable, the space is\n> consolidating aroundâ€¦ platforms. Again. People who will run servers for you,\n> and iterate on the new functionality that emerges. Infura, OpenSea, Coinbase,\n> Etherscan."
