A data serialization framework where given a schema, Typical generates efficient serialization and deserialization code for various programming languages.

The main difference with other tools like [Protocol Buffers] and [Apache Thrift] is that Typical has a more modern type system based on algebraic data types, emphasizing a safer programming style with non-nullable types and exhaustive pattern matching.\"
