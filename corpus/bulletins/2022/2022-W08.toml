title = "Thoughts On Markdown"
summary = "An article reflecting on almost 20 years of Markdown, whether it's original intent is (still) valid and what could be a way forward with a balanced set of features, extensibility and ease of entrance.\n\nI found the article initially thought-provoking but rapidly deriving into a niche solution for solving the author's employer problems. It completely ignores situations like offline-first, overemphasises the need for real-time collaborative experiences and ignores XML all together which is at the very least a precursor of [Portable Text](https://github.com/portabletext/portabletext), the solution he is pitching for."
