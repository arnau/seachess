summary = """
An article superficially exploring project management approaches based on amount of uncertainty. Although I like the initial framing it lacks depth around variable uncertainty.

Particularly on software projects it says:

> Everyone's job is simultaneously building features and building tools that makes it easier to build features. We end up with layers and layers of abstractions, and each layer reduces the work we have to spend in the layer below. This is obviously great for productivity! It does however mean that software projects will be hard to estimate, and a lot of software projects will be abandoned.

I agree in principle but lacks factors like the impact of abstractions in reduction of future flexibility, internal or external rot (e.g. cutting corners, technical debt, world changing)."""
