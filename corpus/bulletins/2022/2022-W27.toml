title = "Finding and reminding: file organization from the desktop"
summary = "A paper summarizing two independent studies of the ways users organize and find files on their computers. The first study (Barreau 1995) investigated information organization practices among users of DOS, Windows and OS/2. The second study (Nardi, Anderson and Erickson 1995), examined the finding and filing practices of Macintosh users. There were more similarities in the two studies than differences."

summary = "A full stack web framework for JavaScript and TypeScript. At its core, it is a combination of a routing framework and templating engine that renders pages on demand, on the server. In addition to this just-in-time (JIT) rendering on the server, it also provides an interface for rendering components on the client for maximum interactivity. The framework uses Preact and JSX for rendering and templating on both the server and the client."
