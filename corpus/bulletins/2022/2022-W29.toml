title = "Carbon language"
summary = "An experimental programming language successor to C++.\n\n> Carbon is fundamentally a successor language approach, rather than an attempt to incrementally evolve C++.

summary = "A light markup syntax as a reaction of the challenges that Commonmark design decisions impose onto the parsing implementations. It also supports definition lists, footnotes, tables, several new kinds of inline formatting (insert, delete, highlight, superscript, subscript), math, smart punctuation, attributes that can be applied to any element, and generic containers for block-level, inline-level, and raw content."
