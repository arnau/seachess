An article on the use of WebAssembly for cryptographically-proven units of computation.

> WebAssembly allows you to say, I’ve created a single application, and I can prove that that is exactly the application that’s running on all of these instances. Cryptographic proof. And that’s the big win.

You might also enjoy the [talk by on of the persons behind Enarx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=YNzDuiYMcnY&t=14034s)."""
