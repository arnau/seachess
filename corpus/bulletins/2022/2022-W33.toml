A platform for building applications out of WebAssembly code containers. It orchestrates code and manages communication between dependencies. That code can exist as WebAssembly modules, external microservices, workers over a queue, or anything else that speaks the Wasmflow protocol.

Wasmflow takes functional and flow-based concepts from projects like Erlang, Rx, FBP, and Haskell and combines them with concepts from Docker and Kubernetes."""
