It is fairly difficult to exploit it due the amount of conditions that need to align\n\n> On vulnerable systems, CVE-2022-35737 is exploitable when large string inputs are passed to the SQLite implementations of the printf functions and when the format string contains the %Q, %q, or %w format substitution types.\n\nNote that \"large string\" means \"billions of bytes are used in a string\", and also it's only achivable when using such input as an argument in the C API."
