title = "Transparent Telemetry for Open-Source Projects"
summary = "An article on the benefits of telemetry for open source projects by the Go team. Telemetry is a controversial topic and even more when it comes from a company like Google with a track record of doing the wrong thing regarding privacy.\n\n[The Go team wrote three articles describing the proposal and its strengths](https://research.swtch.com/telemetry) and also had a lengthy discussion in GitHub. Worth the time to understand both sides."
