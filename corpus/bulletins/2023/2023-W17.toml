A Python library to assist in the development of applications using large language models (LLMs). It integrates with a couple of dozens of LLM providers (proprietary and open source) including OpenAI and Llama-cpp. [LangChain.js](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs) is an equivalent implementation written in TypeScript.

For a quick overview you might want to read this article instead: [Getting Started with LangChain](https://towardsdatascience.com/getting-started-with-langchain-a-beginners-guide-to-building-llm-powered-applications-95fc8898732c)"""
