# Ten years with the ISO 8601 gem

Ten years ago, I had a need to record information about the duration of my
tasks. I was already familiar with the [ISO8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) specification to
encode dates and times so it felt natural to use the same specification to
encode durations in my dataset.

<!-- body -->

It's never that simple. Although the purpose of the International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) is to aim to standardise, without adoption it's
merely a specification.

In the case of the ISO8601 entitled “Data elements and interchange formats –
Information interchange – Representation of dates and times”, only a subset of
the specification is extremely popular. This subset has dedicated profiles
such as the famous [IETF RFC 3339][rfc3339] but other parts of the
specification have a lack of adoption. To my disappointment, the part about
encoding durations had little love.

At the time, I was developing mostly in [Ruby][ruby] so I started my journey
of making a parser for the ISO8601 duration. My first parser.

I was very fond of regular expressions at the time, and they did serve me well
in this case. However, I got carried away and expanded the project from a handful
of functions to a [proper gem][iso8601_gem] (i.e. a Ruby library) in order to implement
the full specification. This goes from dates and times, to durations and
recurrent time intervals.

Time went by, and I stopped using Ruby. Also, I gradually reduced my interest in
evolving the library. The library had a very mild adoption so I kept updating small
bits and bobs over time. Eventually, I [asked for volunteers to take over its
maintenance][iso8601_maintenance] but so far no one has stepped up.

Anyway, this is the brief story of a pet project that got me a bit obssessed
with how time is represented in computers and how I got more and more
horrified with the truth behind time. I recommend reading [Time Disorder](https://caolan.uk/articles/time-disorder/).
and [Time on UNIX](https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/05/02/time-on-unix.html)
for a taste.

After 10 years, the ISO8601 specification seems to have more or less the same
dysfunctional adoption. The moral of the story is that I haven't changed that
much either. Now, I'm in a self-imposed need to have a parser for ISO8601 weeks
such as `2020-W30`. This time, my language of choice is Rust and the main
library for handling dates and times, [Chrono][chrono], seems to lack precisely
what I need. Oh well!
