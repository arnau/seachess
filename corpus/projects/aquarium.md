# Aquarium

Aquarium is a tool to transform the Seaches' source content into different outputs, such as [Zola].

[Zola]: https://www.getzola.org/

<!-- body -->

It's written in [Rust], uses [SQLite] as a cache storage and is very single-purpose oriented.

It started as a reaction from using [Gatsby] and [Material-UI], both very flexible tools which add a natural overhead both in compile time and amount of dependencies.
