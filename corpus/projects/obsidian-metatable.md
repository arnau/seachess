# Obsidian Metatable

An [Obsidian] plugin to display the full frontmatter block instead of just the list of tags.

[Obsidian]: https://obsidian.md/

<!-- body -->

[Obsidian] is a good tool to organise interlinked notes but relies too little on metadata. This plugin brings metadata forward a bit more within the constraints Obsidian itself imposes.

The project is built using [TypeScript] and [Web Components], in particular it uses the Shadow DOM to minimise the potential conflicts with other plugins that are fiddling with the Obsidian views.
