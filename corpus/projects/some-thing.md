# Some Thing

A tool to manage “some“ collections.

<!-- body -->

“some” collections are curated sets of resources with their name, url, description and a tag classification system. For example, [some-sqlite] is my curation of SQLite resources.

It borrows the idea of the [Awesome] lists but structuring and standardising the data using [Tabular Data Package] whilst keeping the convenience of displaying the collection as [Markdown].

[Awesome]: https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/
[Markdown]: https://commonmark.org/
[Tabular Data Package]: https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-package/
[some-sqlite]: https://github.com/arnau/some-sqlite/
