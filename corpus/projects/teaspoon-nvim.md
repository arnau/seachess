# Teaspoon

A [Lush] theme for [Neovim] derived from the dark [Seoul256] theme for Vim.

[Lush]: http://git.io/lush.nvim
[Seoul256]: https://github.com/junegunn/seoul256.vim
[Neovim]: https://neovim.io/

<!-- body -->

After more than a decade of using Vim I made the switch to Neovim. As always no colorscheme feels completely right so this is another attempt to have one that suits my eyes.
As a consequence I retired both Vim attempts: [teaspoon.vim] and [stonespoon.vim].

This time around instead of using Vimscript, I use [Lua] and [Lush], a colorscheme abstraction that makes creating a colorscheme a breeze.
